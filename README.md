# Overview
All code was made by me.

I started this project out of curiosity to see if it was possible to create a fully polished and fleshed-out game entirely through the VScode terminal. I know at least some of us programmers have thought about it, and well, here it is!

I haven’t decided on a name for the game yet, so for now, it’s called RPGCombat! RPGCombat is a roguelike game where you play cards to defeat enemies, encounter events, and experience much, much more!

Currently, the game is in very early development, so you won’t see much content yet. There are missing features, incomplete sections, But I do intentd to finsh the game entirely soon.

This is a tutoral explaning the game.
